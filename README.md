This project aims to make it easier for students to find apartments and group each other. We offer a new idea: swapping your place from one apartment to another for a set period, which can help students save money and find an apartment on the go without worrying about a reservation or a meeting. 
We have also provided a friendly user interface for individuals in general, we have a wide range of options, such as Hotels, chalets, apartments, and studios.
The technology used: JavaScript, SCSS, HTML
